# Food Prices & Inflation Tracking Pipeline

This repository contains a data pipeline built with **Apache Airflow** to extract, transform, and load (ETL) food price and inflation data for **Kenya**. It supports economic insights and policy analysis by providing structured historical data for visualization and analytics.

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on two main ETL workflows:

### Food Prices ETL
- Extracts and loads commodity price data across Kenyan markets into a PostgreSQL database.

### Inflation ETL
- Fetches annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) data from the World Bank API and stores it in PostgreSQL.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run the pipeline locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/food-prices-project.git
cd food_prices_project

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory with your PostgreSQL credentials:

PG_HOST=your_host
PG_PORT=your_port
PG_DATABASE=your_db
PG_USER=your_user
PG_PASSWORD=your_password

Replace placeholders with your actual PostgreSQL connection details.

5. Initialize and Start Airflow

export AIRFLOW_HOME=$(pwd)/airflow  # Set Airflow home directory

airflow db init

airflow users create \
    --username admin \
    --firstname John \
    --lastname Doe \
    --role Admin \
    --email admin@example.com \
    --password admin_password

airflow webserver --port 8080
airflow scheduler
